### OAuth 2.0 React Implementation Guide

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This guide will help you implement OAuth authentication in your React app using our custom OAuth client library. For this instance, we'll be using [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) as a provider.

### My understanding of the auth flow

- The user clicks on the login/sign-up CTA and gets redirected to a third-party authentication provider (like **Auth0**).
- The user fills in their credentials, grants necessary permissions, and completes the authentication process.
- The user is then redirected back to our site, either authenticated or with an error.
- During the redirect, the user returns with an **authorization code**, which is used by your auth client to exchange for an **access token** and potentially a **refresh token**.
- Finally, the user is either signed in with a valid session stored in **`localStorage`** or **`sessionStorage`**, or an error is thrown.

### Structure

We have divided our application into two parts: `client` and `server`.

- **Client**: Contains the demo application, which is utilizing our server to make necessary requests.
- **Server**: Contains two core files:
  - `server.js`: This file is responsible for creating and instantiating the entire authentication flow.
  - `oauth-client.js`: This file defines and creates a standard OAuth client, providing the foundation for `server.js` to handle the auth flow.

### Developer Checklist

- [x] Use your OAuth client library to implement a login flow
- [x] Include a login button that initiates the OAuth process
- [x] Handle the OAuth callback and securely manage tokens
- [x] Display user information after successful authentication
- [x] Ensure the library is platform-agnostic, capable of running in both browser and server environments without relying on browser-specific APIs
